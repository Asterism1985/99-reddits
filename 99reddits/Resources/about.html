		<h1>About 99 reddits</h1>
		<p>
			99 reddits is not made by the folks who make reddit.com or anyone at reddit inc.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's made by a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyEdward.compact">redditor</a>.
		</p>
		<h1>Why Upgrade?</h1>
		<p>
			I built this app because I wanted to use it myself, but I would like to cover costs. Upgrading is totally optional, of course. Most of the features are free.
		</p>
		<p>
			But if you choose to upgrade, you're contributing directly to making this a better app. I would also prefer to <strong>keep the app free of ads</strong>, which I find intrusive.
		</p>
		<h1>Support</h1>
		<p>
			Visit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/99reddits.compact">/r/99reddits</a> to ask questions or complain about the app. I love feedback!
